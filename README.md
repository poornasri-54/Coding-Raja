To-Do List App (Python) - Project Description
📌 Project Overview
The To-Do List App is a simple yet efficient command-line application that helps users manage their tasks by allowing them to add, remove, view, and mark tasks as completed. The project utilizes Python with JSON-based storage, making it lightweight and easy to use without requiring a database.

🚀 Features
✔ View Tasks – Displays all tasks along with their priority level and due date.
✔ Add Task – Allows users to add a new task with a description, priority (high/medium/low), and due date.
✔ Remove Task – Users can remove a task by selecting the task number.
✔ Mark as Completed – Tasks can be marked as completed, making task tracking easier.
✔ Persistent Storage – Tasks are saved in a JSON file (tasks.json) to retain data even after closing the program.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (Core Programming Language)
JSON (Data Storage for Tasks)
OS Module (File Handling)
Datetime Module (Managing Due Dates)

Budget Tracker (Python) - Project Description
📌 Project Overview
The Budget Tracker is a simple yet effective command-line application that helps users manage their income and expenses. It allows users to record transactions, analyze spending, and calculate their remaining budget. The project utilizes Python with JSON-based storage, ensuring data is saved even after exiting the program.

🚀 Features
✔ Enter Income – Users can log their income along with the amount.
✔ Enter Expense – Users can record their expenses by category and amount.
✔ View Expenses – Displays all expense transactions with date, category, and amount.
✔ Calculate Budget – Calculates the remaining budget by subtracting expenses from total income.
✔ Expense Analysis – Provides a breakdown of spending per category for better financial management.
✔ Persistent Storage – All transactions are stored in a JSON file (transactions.json) for future reference.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (Core Programming Language)
JSON (Data Storage for Transactions)
OS Module (File Handling)
Datetime Module (Timestamping Transactions)
🔹 How It Works
1️⃣ The program loads income and expenses from transactions.json (if available).
2️⃣ Users interact via a menu-driven interface to add/view income, expenses, and analyze spending.
3️⃣ Transactions are automatically saved after every addition.
4️⃣ The program calculates the remaining budget by subtracting total expenses from income.
5️⃣ Users can view spending insights based on expense categories.
6️⃣ The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.
